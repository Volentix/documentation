## Reporting a Security Issue

The `Volentix` team and community take all security issues in all ecosystem projects seriously. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you on every step of the way. We pledge to acknowledge your contributions and reward your awesome work - in a timely and professional manner.

Report security issues by emailing the lead maintainer at security@volentixlabs.com - and if desired,

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information, guidance or POCs.

Although we appreciate being informed about upstream vulnerabilities and will endeavor to work around or patch such problems, we advise reporting security issues in third-party modules to those responsible for maintaining the module. Only extreme cases will ever warrant hot-patching or offensive-forking.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the triage, fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Manage the relationship with the initial submitter.
  * Confirm the problem and determine affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
  * Prepare statement to the community.
  * Confirmation back to the Foundation.

Throughout the process, the Foundation team will be responsible for:
  
  * Monitoring the process.
  * Renumerating the individual(s) who reported the bug based on industry standards of severity and reporter responsiveness.
  * Preparing announcements.
