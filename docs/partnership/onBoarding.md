## Documenation Strategy

Organization managing repos must adhere to the general patterns and principles for the management of documenation within their repo.

All repos have the following documenation:

1. ReadTheDocs: Any documenation about the product, such as its architecture, or features, will be documented on the `docs` folder. ReadTheDocs listens to this folder and will automatically generate the website. For example, the current docuemation for this repo can be found [here](www.google.com)
