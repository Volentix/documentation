# Volentix Repository Management Guide

The following document outlines the best practices and principles for the structure and management of Volentix projects. The intent is to provide our community with a clear and concise way of discovering projects in a easy and familiar way. We have done all we can to adhere to best practices and principles already familiar with the broader Github community.

## File Structure

Each Repository, at a minimum, will have the following files for contributors to familiarize themselves with the projects. Note that many of these may point to centralized

  - **.github /**
    - **CONTRIBUTING.md:** Details the process for contributing to the project.
  - **CHANGELOG.md:** Logs changes to the project by decending release.
  - **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:** Details the community rules for good citizen principles.
  - **README.md:** Standard readme.
  - **ROADMAP:** Project roadmap and milestones
  - **SECURITY.md:** The security protocals for the project.
